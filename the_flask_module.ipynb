    "#Why Flask?\n",
    "Flask is very simple and clean. It amazing easy to create a working application which serves real data (the heart_beat example is production code with 588 lines of code of which 231 is tests and 51 are project configuration that I wrote in 6 hours). Flask also lets you just start writing code without having to deal with any boiler plate (beyond two lines).\n",

    "\n",
    "Flask is also just an [amazing code base](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask). There has been more then one occuasion where I've looked at the source code to answer a question and it's always a pleasant experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flask community is also very active and rabid. [The extensions library is filled with Gem's](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) like [Flask-Cache](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Cache/), [Flask-DebugToolbar](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/), [Flask-lesscss](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-lesscss), [Flask-login](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Login), [Flask-WTF](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-WTF)and [Flask-SQlAlchemy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-SQLAlchemy).\n",

    "If no one has made a Flask Extension that suits your needs then [creating an extension](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/extensiondev/) requires about an hour worth of reading, a `setup.py` file, and  a class that modifies a flask app object.\n",

There's some things about sessions, configuration, templating, url routing, http headers, http requests, cookies, and message flashing but this is the majority of everything. To be fair the `@app.route()` call is doing thousands of Python WSGI magic and the `app.run()` call is spinning up a entire http server with a WSGI module soooo...\n",
