    "#Why Flask?\n",
    "Flask is very simple and clean. It amazing easy to create a working application which serves real data (the heart_beat example is production code with 588 lines of code of which 231 is tests and 51 are project configuration that I wrote in 6 hours). Flask also lets you just start writing code without having to deal with any boiler plate (beyond two lines).\n",

    "[The flaskr example page](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/examples/flaskr/flaskr.py) is a fully functional blog (logins, logouts, page addition, homepage) in 110 lines of code backed by a sqlite3 database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is also just an [amazing code base](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask). There has been more then one occuasion where I've looked at the source code to answer a question and it's always a pleasant experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flask community is also very active and rabid. [The extensions library is filled with Gem's](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) like [Flask-Cache](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Cache/), [Flask-DebugToolbar](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/), [Flask-lesscss](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-lesscss), [Flask-login](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Login), [Flask-WTF](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-WTF)and [Flask-SQlAlchemy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-SQLAlchemy).\n",
    "\n",
    "If no one has made a Flask Extension that suits your needs then [creating an extension](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/extensiondev/) requires about an hour worth of reading, a `setup.py` file, and  a class that modifies a flask app object.\n",
